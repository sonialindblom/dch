abstract = {Query suggestion plays an important role in improving the usability of search engines. Although some recently proposed methods can make meaningful query suggestions by mining query patterns from search logs, none of them are context-aware - they do not take into account the immediately preceding queries as context in query suggestion. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware query suggestion approach which is in two steps. In the offine model-learning step, to address data sparseness, queries are summarized into concepts by clustering a click-through bipartite. Then, from session data a concept sequence suffix tree is constructed as the query suggestion model. In the online query suggestion step, a user's search context is captured by mapping the query sequence submitted by the user to a sequence of concepts. By looking up the context in the concept sequence sufix tree, our approach suggests queries to the user in a context-aware manner. We test our approach on a large-scale search log of a commercial search engine containing 1:8 billion search queries, 2:6 billion clicks, and 840 million query sessions. The experimental results clearly show that our approach outperforms two baseline methods in both coverage and quality of suggestions. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

By exploiting the full potential of the planning phase of the SDLC (systems development lifecycle), a digital project manager can develop a compelling business case for their proposed project. By using SWOT analysis as well as additional considerations, the project manager should identify how the project will address critical organizational (business) issues and success factors as well as provide a compelling case for action. In particular, the most successful business cases develop compelling cases for action by carefully crafting solid arguments for why the digital project being proposed is the most important project an organization to undertake out of all the potential projects that might exist.Originality value - This paper fills a gap in the digital project management literature by providing a step-by-step process for developing compelling business cases for digital library projects.},

  abstract  = {Purpose
– This paper aims to propose a model which serves to illustrate that a number of factors are responsible for, and contribute to, the different forms of sustainability of digital information services. It also seeks to identify some areas of information research and their interrelationship in the context of sustainability of digital information services.
Design/methodology/approach
– This research is based on critical analysis of a range of research and policy documents, and an environment scan, in different aspects of sustainability of information systems and services. Recent and relevant past research studies as well as some relevant government policies and initiatives have been critically analyzed in order to identify various factors that are said to contribute to the economic, social and environmental sustainability of information services.
Findings
– It is noted that the sustainability of information has not been studied within the mainstream information science research. However, several previous research studies have produced findings and models that can be used to achieve some aspects of sustainability of information. It is also noted that various parameters of sustainability are inter-related and hence a proper research agenda has to be prepared, and concerted research efforts are needed in order to be able to develop and manage sustainable digital information services.
Practical implications
– A model has been proposed showing the various factors to be studied for achieving the economic, social and environmental sustainability of information services. Interrelations among the different factors and their implications for sustainability of digital information systems services are also discussed.
Originality/value
– The model is expected to open new vistas for research in the economic, social and environmental sustainability of digital information systems and services. It will develop new tools, technologies and applications for building sustainable information systems and services appropriate for the digital era.},

  abstract  = {SfM-MVS (Structure from Motion and Multiple-View Stereophotogrammetry) is part of a series of technological progresses brought to the field of earth-sciences during the last decade or so, which has allowed geoscientists to collect unprecedented precise and extensive DSMs (Digital Surface Model) for virtually no cost, rivaling LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology. Previous work on SfM-MVS in geosciences has been solely exploring data acquired for the purpose of SfM-MVS, but no research has been done in the exploration of photographic archives for geomorphological purposes. Therefore, the present publications aims to present the usage of SfM-MVS applied to historical aerial photographs in Japan, in order to (1) demonstrate the potentials to extract topographical and vegetation data and (2) to present the potential for chronological analysis of landscape evolution. SfM-MVS was implemented on black-and-white and colour aerial photographs of 1966, 1976, 1996, 2006 and 2013, using the commercial software Photoscanpro®. Firstly, the photographs were masked, tied to GPS points; secondly the positions of the cameras and the 3D pointcloud were calculated; and thirdly the 3D surface was created. Data were then exported in the GIS software ArcGIS for analysis. Results also proved satisfactory for the reconstruction of 3D past-geomorphological landscapes in coastal areas, riverine areas, and in hilly and volcanic areas. They also prove that the height of trees and large vegetation features can also be calculated from aerial photographs alone. Diachronic analysis of the evolution in 3D landforms presented more difficulties, because the resolution of the early photographs was lower than the recent ones. Volume and surface calculations should therefore be conducted carefully. Although the method holds merit and great promise in the exploration of active landscapes that have widely changed during the 20th century; the authors have also reflected on the issues linked to large datasets, mostly because the processing of these large datasets is still in need of improvement. Moreover there is no proof that an ever increasing resolution brings any major advance to the geomorphological paradigms.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the use of the strategic management tool, Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats or SWOT analysis, and to assess how the methodology has been used as well as changes to the methodology. The findings both for and against SWOT analysis should lead to a balanced view of the technique as well as yield ideas for needed theory building. Using the ABInform Global{\textregistered} database, academic peer-reviewed articles were compiled indicating SWOT as one of the article's key index and search words. The use of SWOT analysis continues to permeate the academic peer-reviewed literature. Research supports SWOT analysis as a tool for planning purposes. Over the past decade, SWOT research has focused on analyzing organizations for recommended strategic actions. As a methodology for strategic positioning, SWOT analysis has been extended beyond companies to countries and industries and is used in virtually every published business case positioned for business student analysis. Additional use of SWOT is as teaching tools by consultants, trainers and educators. This paper provides a summary of the research studies and suggests paths for future research. This paper is limited to analyzing reports found in a selection of academic peer-reviewed business journals. However, research implications for applying SWOT analysis provides a broad spectrum of industry analysis in North America, Europe, and Asia. Additional limitations are the need to link SWOT analysis to other strategic tools and methodologies for further theory building, since past research continues to lack quantifiable findings on the success of the SWOT analysis. A fresh view of new directions and implementations for SWOT analysis, as well as other strategic planning tools that can be combined with SWOT, provides guidance for practitioners and policy makers alike. The article adds value to the existing literature as the first summary of SWOT research indicating its uses and limitations. Support of its usage and place in the strategic literature is validated. The SWOT methodology is pervasive, in large part, due to its simplicity. In addition, the use of SWOT as a proven developmental, results-oriented strategic planning tool is also extended, although further research leading to theory building is warranted and recommended.},

Witty, commonsensical, and eminently practical, it’s one of the best-loved and most recommended books on the subject. Now Steve returns with fresh perspective to reexamine the principles that made Don’t Make Me Think a classic–with updated examples and a new chapter on mobile usability. And it’s still short, profusely illustrated…and best of all–fun to read. If you’ve read it before, you’ll rediscover what made Don’t Make Me Think so essential to Web designers and developers around the world. If you’ve never read it, you’ll see why so many people have said it should be required reading for anyone working on Web sites. “After reading it over a couple of hours and putting its ideas to work for the past five years, I can say it has done more to improve my abilities as a Web designer than any other book.” –Jeffrey Zeldman, author of Designing with Web Standards},

This is partly due to his scientific contributions in many areas: insights into the sound patterns of English and Russian, ideas about the nature of metered verse, ways of thinking about phonological features and rules, and models for argumentation about phonological description and phonological theory. But he has had an equally profound influence through his role as a teacher and mentor, and this personal influence has not been limited to students who follow closely in his intellectual and methodological footsteps. It has been just as strong-or stronger-among researchers who disagree with his specific ideas and even his general approach, or who work in entirely different subfields. This appreciation is a synthesis of reflections from colleagues and former students whom he has formed, informed, and inspired.},

  abstract  = {Purpose - This paper aims to encapsulate the main procedure and key findings of a qualitative research on end-users' interactions with web-based search tools in order to demonstrate how the concept of "information visibility" emerged and how an integrative model of information visibility and information seeking on the web was constructed.Design methodology approach - The study was formed of three parts. The first looked at conceptions of the Invisible Web; the second explored conceptualisations of the causes of search success failure; the third organised the findings of parts 1 and 2 into a series of theoretical frameworks. Data collection was carried out in three phases based on interviews with a sample of biologists.Findings - The first part led to the development of a model of information visibility which suggests a complementary definition for the Invisible Web. The results also showed the participants were aware of the possibility that they had missed some relevant information in their searches. However, perceptions of the importance and the volume of missed information varied, so users reacted differently to the possibility that they were missing information. The third part indicated the "Locus of Control" and "Attribution Theory" that can help us to better understand web-based information seeking patterns. Moreover, "Bounded Rationality" and "Satisficing Theory" supported the inductive findings and showed that users' estimates of the likely volume and importance of missed information affect their decision to persist in searching.Research limitations implications - The study creates new understanding of web users' information seeking behaviour which contributes to the theoretical basis of web search research. It also raises various questions within the context of library and information science practice to know whether, and if so how, we can assist end-users to develop more efficient search strategies and satisfactory approaches.Originality value - The research adopted a combination of inductive-deductive methods with a qualitative approach in the area of information seeking on the web which is mainly dominated by quantitative studies.},

For web applications of a reasonable size, accessing information only by navigating the application hierarchy can become cumbersome and compromise usability. Therefore, it's important that information within web applications be made searchable to get users to desired items quickly and efficiently. Searching can be done either in an unrestricted manner, where users enter their query as a set of keywords or key phrases in a search field, or in a directed and structured manner, where users specify desired values of the item attributes they are searching. Simple searches are usually sufficient for most users, but those who have more experience and prefer specifying their search precisely may benefit from using advanced search, which allows the formulation of complex search queries. Regardless of the search mechanism offered, users can always benefit by getting some guidance on how they can improve their searches and formulate better queries. Users are typically offered mechanisms such as filtering or faceted search to narrow down the list of search results to a manageable number.},

Ninety-one interviews, each describing an incident when the interviewee needed information for an SL activity, were carried out in SL itself. Data was analysed using existing research models of IB and inductively. It was established that models of IB derived in real-world settings are also applicable in VWs, and the models are enriched with new SL examples. Information encountering emerged as a dominant mode of information discovery, but behaviours such as browsing, monitoring, purposive search and verifying were also identified. Seven categories of need and four major categories of outcome emerged from inductive analysis of the data. A wide variety of sources were used by the participants and a new term, blended IB, is proposed to describe this varied IB. This study contributes insights into the everyday and practice-based IB of academics and professionals that is lacking in the literature.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of a large e-book touch-wall, on which the visualized interface provides information in a fun, hedonic-oriented fashion on readers of different ages browsing in a public library. The authors examined how emotions exert influence on the information-seeking behaviors of readers.
Design/methodology/approach
The authors investigated the emotions and responsive eye movements of 38 readers in various age groups when operating the touch-wall interface of New Taipei City Library. They were monitored using an eye-tracker and a camera that videotaped their spontaneous facial expressions. A facial affect scoring technique was used to measure emotions and statistical analysis was used to explore the relationships among the scope of eye movements, emotions and information-seeking behavior of readers of different ages.
Findings
Results revealed that participants experienced an array of emotions, such as contemplative, doubtful or peaceful. The older the participant was, the smaller the scope of eye movements was. Scope was also affected by emotions (both positive and negative).
Originality/value
These results serve as useful reference for exploration into human – information interaction, perceived ease of use, affected searching and the formulation of knowledge structures in visualized interfaces.},
